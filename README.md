Thanks to pruby for the sphere and dome builder code.  
Thanks for the original program by Michiel and Vliekkie and Aeolun for fixing and making the program readable.

The program can use Mining and Resupply Modules (from MiscPeripherals) and is best built with a Chunkloading module (also MiscPeripherals) on SMP.  
This fixes the turtle stopping to work if it gets unloaded (you leave the world or log off etc.) but does not work in SSP.  
When you use a resupply turtle: Place your resupply station left to the turtle and then start the program.
Put at least one building block in slot 1 in the inventory and then place all additional material in the resupply station. 
The turtle will automatically refill from the station when it runs out of material.
