Minecraft Computercraft Turtle Versatile Shape Builder

Thanks to pruby for the sphere and dome builder code. Thanks for the original program by Michiel and Vliekkie and Aeolun for fixing and making the program readable.

There are 2 Version of the Program:  
The normal one is for normal turtles.  
The rsshape program is for resupply turtles. It uses the resupply module from MiscPeripherals to refill the construction blocks for the turtle
